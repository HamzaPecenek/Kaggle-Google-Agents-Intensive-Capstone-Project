Agent System Architecture\n\nFocusMate is a small multi-agent system built with the Google Agents Development Kit (ADK).\n\n### Agents\n1. **Task Intake Agent**\n   - Collects tasks from the user.\n   - Extracts fields (task name, deadline, duration, priority).\n   - Uses a custom tool `save_task()` to store tasks.\n\n2. **Study Planner Agent**\n   - Reads tasks using the `load_tasks()` tool.\n   - Generates a structured study plan for the day or week.\n   - Uses session state to remember prior conversations.\n   - Supports daily or weekly scheduling.\n\n3. **Reflection Agent** (optional but included for multi-agent variety)\n   - Asks what was completed.\n   - Updates task status.\n   - Helps refine the next study plan.\n\n### Tools\n1. **save_task(task_dict)**\n   - Appends task information to a local JSON file.\n2. **load_tasks()**\n   - Reads the JSON task file and returns structured data.\n\n### Memory / Session\n- Uses **InMemorySessionService** from ADK.\n- Maintains session context across steps.\n- Agents share context via a single session.\n\n### Flow\nUser → Task Intake Agent → JSON Tool Storage → Study Planner Agent → Schedule Output → (optional) Reflection Agent.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3. Agent Roles\n\n### Task Intake Agent\nGoal:\n- Convert natural language into structured task objects.\n\nResponsibilities:\n- Ask follow-up questions when information is missing.\n- Call `save_task` tool.\n- Confirm tasks were saved.\n\n### Study Planner Agent\nGoal:\n- Build actual study plans from saved tasks.\n\nResponsibilities:\n- Retrieve tasks using `load_tasks`.\n- Sort tasks by deadline & priority.\n- Allocate tasks in a day/week plan.\n- Store small session context so subsequent queries refine the plan.\n\n### Reflection Agent\nGoal:\n- Track progress across time.\n\nResponsibilities:\n- Ask the user what they completed.\n- Update status field in the JSON.\n- Trigger re-planning with updated info.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.

Memory & Session Design\n\nFocusMate uses a single `InMemorySessionService`:\n\n- All agents share one session.\n- Session stores:\n  - Last generated plan.\n  - Last set of loaded tasks.\n  - Meta notes (e.g. preferred study hours).\n\nThis satisfies the \"Sessions & Memory\" requirement.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 6.
